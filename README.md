**Performance: Added Performance and other aspects image in the root directory

**Confusion: There were a few aspects I didn’t fully grasp, such as the exact implementation of key validations. For instance, I included some UI validations not explicitly mentioned in the requirements, which led to confusion. Additionally, I wasn’t entirely clear about the specific details regarding the tenant ID, is_job_work, and factory ID. With a better understanding of these elements, I’m confident I could have delivered the task more effectively
